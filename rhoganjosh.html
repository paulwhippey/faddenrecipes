            <li class="list">200ml plain yoghurt</li>
            <li class="list">400ml chicken or beef stock</li>
            <li class="list">1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li class="list">1 teaspoon ground fennel seeds</li>
            <li class="list">1/2 teaspoon garam massala</li>
            <li class="list">1 tin chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li class="list">1 tablespoon chopped coriander</li>
            <li class="list">Tempering (Optional)</li>
            <li class="list">1 tablespoon ghee</li>

            <h2>Method</h2>
            <ol>
            <li><p>Heat the oil or ghee in a heavy-based casserole dish that you have a lid for, add the crushed cardamom, cinnamon sticks and peppercorns and stir over a high heat for 30 seconds or so until they release their flavours into the oil. Add the meat and salt, sear over a high heat for about 10 minutes, turning frequently to brown the meat on all sides. Take care not to overload the pan as this would simply leach the juices out and stew the meat. Once browned, remove the meat and drain on kitchen paper.</p></li>
            <li><p>Into the same pan, add the onions and salt, cook over a medium heat for 15 minutes or until golden brown. Add the ginger and garlic paste and cook for a couple of minutes. The paste tends to stick to the pan, so keep stirring continuously.</p></li>      
            <li><p>Now add the fried meat, chilli powder and ground coriander and cook for a further 2-3 minutes. Take care to handle the meat carefuly so the meat does not come off the bone at this stage. Whisk in the yoghurt gradually, stiring continuously until it gets absorbed into the mix (Once all the yoghurt is absorbed, add the stock or water. Take care not to add all the yoghurt at once as it will lower the temperature of the sauce and the yoghurt will split.</p></li>
            <li><p>Cover with a tight lid and cook over a low heat for 30-60 minutes until the meat is soft, You may need to add some more stock or water if the sauce is thick or it requires more moisture to cook. If you do not have a suitable pan. the pot-roasted and browned meat could be put in a braising tray with the liquid, covered with foil and braised in the oven (160-170C/Gas Mark 3-3 1/2) for about 2 hours. (Although it's not traditional to finish this dish off in the oven, I find the results are much better if the last part of the cooking happens in an oven, as the textures are much better and the meat does not get broken.)</p></li>
            <li><p>Check that the meat is cooked; it should casily fall off the bone when it's done. Sprinkle in the ground ginger, fennel and garam masala.</p></li>
            <li><p>For a special finishing touch, tie up the rattan jyoth/beetroot in a muslin cloth. Heat the ghee in a pan, add the rattan jyoth/beetroot and let it infuse for a minute. Add the infused ghee to the shanks and simmer for 2 minutes. When the sauce turns dark red in colour, take out and discard the muslin</p></li>
            <li><p>Remove the meat from the sauce to a serving plate. Add the cream and chopped coriander to the pan and bring the sauce back to a simmer, then pour over the meat.</p></li>
            <li><p>Serve with either steamed, boiled or basmati rice and a bread of your choice</p></li>
