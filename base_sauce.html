            <li><p>Heat the oil in a large saucepan with a tight fitting lid and add the sliced onions. Stir on a high heat for a minute or two and then reduce the heat a little. Continue to cook the onion, stirring regularly, for about 10 minutes until the onion is transparent and beginning to brown at the edges. Add the salt, stir well and turn down the heat as low as you can. Cover the pan and continue to cook the onion for 20 minutes, stirring 3 or 4 times in that period. The salt will prevent the onion from browning and help it soften, but be careful it does not stick to the pan. Add the ginger and garlic to the onion. Turn the heat up a little and cook for a minute or two, until aromatic. Add the water and bring to the boil. Turn the heat down and simmer the mixture, partly covered, for 20 minutes.</p></li>
            <li><p>Ladle half the mixture into a blender jug and blend until smooth. Pour the blended mixture into a clean bowl and repeat with the other half of the mixture. Wash and dry the saucepan.</p></li>
            <li><p>Place the contents of the can of tomatoes into the rinsed blender jug and blend until smooth. Place the cleaned saucepan onto a medium heat and heat some oil. Add the tomato paste, turmeric and paprika and cook for about 30 seconds. Add the blended tomatoes and bring to the boil. Turn down the heat and cook for about 10 minutes. Add the blended onion mixture to the tomatoes and bring to the boil again. Turn down the heat so that the sauce simmers gently. As the sauce simmers, skim off any froth that rises to the surface. Simmer for 20 minutes. Use immediately, or cool and refrigerate for up to 4 days. Freeze for up to 1 month.</p></li>
